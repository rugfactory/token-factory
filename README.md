# RUGACTORY TOKEN FACTORY

> Note: I tried to optimze the size of this. the optimed size of the contracts cause's malfunctions, so i will be creating my own custom contract, rather than just chage a few lines of this.
> Other than doing nothing for size, I have added some documentaion to help if you want to take and deploy this.

Just for 2.5 â“ƒ issue a brand new fungible token and own everything.

this repo is a fork of [https://github.com/near-examples/token-factory](https://github.com/near-examples/token-factory), and contains the contract code for both a factory and a token contract
